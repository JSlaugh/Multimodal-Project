  Introduction
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  Data mining, data warehouses, data privacy, and big data— all these words have sprung up over the last 20 years as
  computers have become more sophisticated. The public jokes about how big brother is always watching, your phone is
  always listening, and our phones know increasingly more about us than our families. Are these jokes far from the
  truth?
  In today’s world it’s not unlikely.
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">


  For example, one might look up the MCAT on google and then be bombarded with ads about study tips for the following
  weeks (Aragon). One search for a wedding ring might lead to a social media feed full of overpriced bands. One click
  comparing cat food prices leads to ads for pet flea remover. How does this happen? Cookies play a big part in it. Not
  the sugary ones that kids love, but the ones that companies keep on consumer’s computers. This paper will discuss data
  mining, big data, and several companies that are involved in this industry— informing readers on the growing
  stockpiles
  of their data and what it is currently being used for. In addition, I will focus on where the technology world is
  headed
  and what might potentially change to protect the public and help their lives to remain private.

</div>
<div class="heading">
  Browsing Data Collection
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph left">
  Now consumers might wonder how data is collected. It all starts when they click on a new website and are then prompted
  to accept the terms and services. Most users click “yes” and move on with their day. Without realizing it they have
  agreed for the computer to download another cookie which will track their data. Some might wonder why this is allowed.
  Cookies are a means for the website to be personalized to a consumer’s tastes and needs. They access previous internet
  searches and create a website tailored to a specific individual (Computer). The problem lies with different types of
  cookies. Some cookies only last for the duration of your stay on a website, but some can last longer, even up to
  several
  years.

</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  These cookies can be used to make an internet profile for you, which can be sold between companies. For example,
  Target
  keeps track of their customers online and instore shopping purchases and what websites their customers are looking at.
  They target which advertisements and coupons they want to send to their customers. Their ability to profile consumers
  led to a father getting angry because he didn’t know why his teenage daughter was getting ads for products for
  pregnant
  women. Little did he know that his daughter was pregnant and hadn’t told him yet, but Target knew through her cookies
  (Hill).
</div>
<div class="heading">
  Current Data Collection in Companies
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  Some might say that it’s just consumers companies are targeting, but there are more than just consumers who are being
  watched. In recent years companies have started to track their assets even more closely. Amazon and Humanyze both
  collect data on their employees as they are at work. Amazon keeps track of how many items are being processed by each
  employee. Their RF scanners keep track of how fast they are working and if they don’t meet their quota they are
  reported
  by the system to their managers. Employees at Amazon report that their quotas are very high and if you don’t scan an
  item every 10 seconds you can’t hope to meet them (Skarda).
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  This system, while strenuous, makes sense for many people whereas Humanzye’s tracking might seem much more intrusive.
  They require all employees to keep a badge on them that listens and tracks movement. It knows where they are in
  relation
  to where they are supposed to be and keeps track of every conversation, including keeping track of how many
  conversations you have with someone of the opposite gender (Areheart). The company claims they are tracking the
  working
  efficiency of their employees. But at what point do you draw the line for worker’s privacy? This sort of tracking can
  become more prevalent in other areas as computers can automatically keep tabs on employees as they go about their day.
  What if Humanyze never told their employees that they were monitoring them with AI? These situations are feasible,
  especially considering that companies like Teramind, ActivTrak, Hubstaff and Workpuls track what employees type and
  periodically take pictures of their screen for a manager’s review (HR_Brew). If it’s a work provided device that you
  use, employers can have the software installed on your computer before they even hand it to you.

<div class="heading">
  Medical Data Collection
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  Being monitored without permission is a scary violation of privacy and no one wants that to happen to them . Even when
  we are told our data will not be shared with others, it’s not always as cut and dry as one would think. In the
  insurance
  and medical world, a set of laws called HIPPA protect patient data so that someone can get medical aid and their
  condition won’t be shared without their permission (Medical). However, this only applies if the data being shared can
  be
  identified with the patient. Insurance companies have found that if they remove all identification from the documents
  they receive, they can then sell the health care status of their patients online for billions (Enriquez-Sarano). This
  data is used by big medical companies to find potential solutions to medical issues. But should insurance companies be
  able to sell information about you that you were originally told would be private?
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  The insurance companies don’t stop at just selling your medical history, they also try to know more about you. This
  extra data is called shadow medical records. In his article about shadow medical records data, Price points out
  “Fitness
  trackers, web searches, shopping histories, social media posts, and mobile personal health apps can reveal information
  about an individual’s health” and the insurance companies want to know all that they can. This has led one company,
  IQVIA, to compile a record of 400 million comprehensive anonymous patient records (Price). This isn’t a question of it
  happening to someone else; this is happening to all of us.
</div>
<div class="heading">
  Current Policies in Place
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  There’s hope! Despite all the issues we’ve previously discussed, some government entities are trying to start
  regulating
  these problems. The European Union (EU) passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, which states
  that
  companies must collect all their data legally, meaning they must receive consent from every individual. It also
  prohibits all foreign entities from collecting data on citizens of the EU (Price). This has pushed global companies to
  shift how they collect data. Even though we don’t live in the EU, this restriction has helped to curb some techniques
  of
  tracking.
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph left">
  Following the example of the GDPR, California has passed a law called the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which
  helps protect only the data for individuals in California. The CCPA requires companies to give notice and access
  requirements when a business is accessing data and allows for individuals to delete their record history or even opt
  out
  it being sold. The CCPA has some loopholes like if your data is being used for peer-reviewed research then they might
  not need to notify you. It could also be that if the research is in the public interest, then it doesn’t need to be
  disclosed (Price). Unfortunately, there is not a federal law in place currently to protect individuals not from
  California from these issues.

</div>
<div class="heading">
  Possible Policy Changes
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  If we want a federal law, research needs to be conducted to prove the need. If the government does not believe it to
  be
  an economic asset to the individual, it’s unlikely that they will protect it (Harris). The federal government
  currently
  has laws that effect data privacy, but they are limited to very specific industries and are riddled with loopholes
  because it only protects the types of data that the government believes are important (Harris). If we want a program
  that will bring more protection to consumers, we will need to research the gaps in these laws and find the best way to
  help consumers. California, for example, has 100 data privacy laws. However, they are all limited to content,
  potential
  victims, and modality (Harris). These limitations focus on worst case scenarios and don’t address the original problem
  which is if the consumers should own the data or not.
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  A secondary issue is who would enforce the laws that are enacted. Currently it’s the role of the Federal Trade
  Commission (FTC) to enforce cyber security concerns. Their reach, however, is limited due to laws enacted in 1914
  which
  were made to prevent certain companies from being investigated (Harris). The FTC has power over business customer
  relationships, but they have no control over third parties that collect data and never talk to a consumer. The power
  of
  the FTC seems to focus more on “after the fact fixes” to the problem instead of a preventative focus. I think it’s
  safe
  to question that if the FTC is currently capable of policing the laws that are currently in place, maybe a change in
  how
  the laws are enforced is in order as well. Research could be conducted to help find potential changes to old laws that
  prevent the FTC from doing what is needed.
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  One might wonder what the consequences would be if changes are made to the system we currently have. Google and
  Facebook
  can provide free services because they have the right to sell the data they collect from you. It might be impossible
  to
  create laws that protect individuals if we leave loopholes open for companies that we see as good. It could be that if
  laws were put into place, insurance companies would increase their rates because they have reduced revenues. More laws
  could just lead to hurting honest businesses that care about their customers while other businesses just see paying
  FTC
  fines a part of doing business (Harris).
</div>
<div class="heading">
  Conclusion
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  Questions about who truly owns this data need to be resolved and laws need to be put into place to reflect that. We
  currently don’t have an answer to all the questions, but through more research into how other governments like the
  European Union handle data privacy, we believe that we can come up with a more stable solution . We also believe that
  research needs to be conducted in the realm of consumers’ wants to see what kind of solution would best fit the
  culture
  of our people. Through research of current practices, we can also find solutions that might be simpler than passing
  new
  laws by amending what laws we currently have and repurposing them.
</div>
<div class="bodyparagraph">
  Whether it’s web surfing, employee tracking, or medical world data— data privacy is an important topic that will not
  soon go away. Concerns about data privacy need to be addressed on a national level and through time and effort,
  solutions can be found to help enlighten the public about these issues and find ways to protect their futures. Data
  privacy is an issue that applies to everyone. We all live in the Information Age and every device we own is sending
  and
  reporting more and more information each day. We shouldn’t have to live in fear! Through our efforts we can find
  solutions that will help to protect interests of each individual and the community at large.
